###### Generate an Account-Key (or Domain-Key) in PEM-Format:

    ./certle genrsa 4096 > account_key.pem
> Equivalent to: `openssl genrsa 4096 -out account_key.pem`    
    
###### Register Account-Key with Let's Encrypt ACME-Server

    ./certle register account_key.pem contact@example.com

###### Get Certificate / Renew Certificate

    ./certle cert account_key.pem domain_key.pem \
    	-w /var/www/example.com/ \
    	-d example.com \
    	-d www.example.com \
    	--csr csr.pem \
    	--cert cert.pem \
    	--chain chain.pem \
    	--fullchain fullchain.pem

###### Revoke Certificate

    ./certle revoke account_key.pem cert.pem

###### Deactivate Account

    ./certle deactivate account_key.pem https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/reg/xxxxx
